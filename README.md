# Random Strum Pattern

Random guitar strum pattern generator for practice.
Check it out: [vilda.net/s/rsp](https://vilda.net/s/rsp/).
It should look as follows: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7661193/168054877-45fb21e7-5929-403b-be14-66df3dd7806c.png)

It also contains an initial Python version `random_strum_pattern.py` after which I decided I could make it a small website with a bunch of buttons.

## Contributing

The current version works for me.
It took me an hour to build and I'm satisfied with this yield/investment ratio.
Therefore, please do **not** send me bug/feature requests.
If you however want to contribute, I can review & accept pull requests.

The code is written in TypeScript+Node+Webpack.
Run/compile as follows:

```
npm install
npm run build # or `npm run dev` for local server
```
